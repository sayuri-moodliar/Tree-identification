# Machine learning model to identify tree species
## Background and problem statement
Environmental consultancies are called upon to conduct environmental impact assessments. Part of their brief is to identify endangered or at risk species for conservation, as well as alien species for removal or management.
## Brief
Train and test a machine learning model to identify 200 tree species
## Methodology
Different benchmark classification techniques were used to identify the tree species (specifically crown, bark and leaf identification).
Binary images + extracted features like size, shape,colour, margin, texture were used to train and test the model.
